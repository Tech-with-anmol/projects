# Welcome to Version 4

#### Version 4 is a major update in RSA and will allow users to do even more crazy sh\*t with RSA. 

## New "Server" option!

Yep, you heard it right, there are now 3 servers you can choose from to get AI reply.   
First is `Primary`   
Second is `backup`  
Third is `unstable`   
The first two use same technology, it's just that you can use backup server if primary is down and vice verse. Third server is different

## Did someone say FLAGS?!?

In Future updates of Version 4, you will be able to filter jokes using different kinds of flags, add a joke, find a joke using a special ID and much more!
